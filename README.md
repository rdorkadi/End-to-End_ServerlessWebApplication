# end_to_end_web_application

### Description
The end-to-end web application is using AWS services like Amplify, Lambda, IAM, API Gateway, and DynamoDB. In the following architecture: 

**Amplify** is used for front-end hosting and deployment, allowing developers to build and deploy the web interface. 

**Lambda** provides serverless backend functions, executing business logic in response to events. 

**IAM** (Identity and Access Management) controls permissions for users and services, ensuring secure access to resources. 

**API Gateway** acts as the interface between the frontend and backend, routing requests to the Lambda functions.
 
Finally, **DynamoDB** serves as the NoSQL database for storing and retrieving data, offering scalable and fast performance. Together, these services create a scalable, serverless web app infrastructure.
